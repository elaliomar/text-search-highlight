# React Highlight Search (TypeScript + Vite)

## Description

This is a React-based project that implements a search functionality where the search term highlights matching text within a paragraph, title, and date. Additionally, the number of matches is counted and displayed dynamically.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: As you type in the search input, any matching text within the content is highlighted in yellow.
- **Match Counting**: The total number of highlighted matches is displayed.
- **Clear Input**: The search input can be cleared by clicking the clear button (`X` icon).
- **Content Highlighting**: The project highlights matches in the title, date, and the main content of the paragraph.
